# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a Machine Learning model based on the Iris dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four features:
- 🌱 Sepal Length (cm)
- 🌼 Sepal Width (cm)
- 🌷 Petal Length (cm)
- 🌺 Petal Width (cm)
- 🌸 Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

☁️ Development with IBM Cloud
I utilized IBM Cloud for a seamless development experience:

Set up a virtual environment for running Python scripts.
Used IBM Cloud Object Storage for secure dataset management.
Leveraged IBM Watson Machine Learning for building and deploying models.
Integrated with GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## 🧠 Models Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
